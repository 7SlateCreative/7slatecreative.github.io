Skillcrush Web Designer Blueprint | Fake Music News Site Project

I built this responsive fake music news site for a class project. It involved coding both HTML and CSS and using media queries to insure 
that the site was mobile friendly. 

The design process involved creating a mock-up in Photoshop prior to writing any code.  During this process it was essential to keep the
mobile-first approach in mind.  This approach involves designing for mobile and tablet devices first and then adding additional
content as the screen size gets larger.  

Previously, websites have been designed and coded using Graceful Degradation which requires that designers and developers reduce the 
size of the screen but none of the content is truly responsive.  This does not create a pleasant mobile experience.
